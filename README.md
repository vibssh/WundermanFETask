This project is authored by Vaibhav Shringarpure as a FE Task for Wunderman Thomson Commerce.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, after cloning the project, you can run:

### `npm install`

To run the app in the development mode. you can run this from the root of the project folder <br>
### `gulp`

The page will reload if you make edits. All edits need to be done in the 'src' folder <br>

If you don't want to make any development changes and just want to browse the project you can deploy the 'dist' folder contents to your local or production server. 

It's best to run the project from the local or production server to get optimum results as it uses fetching of data which requires a http protocol instead of browsing as a file 'file://xyz'
